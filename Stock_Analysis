# Ehinmore Adebameno Portfolio on Financial Analysis

# Project - Portfolio Optimization
In this project, I will build two $10,000 investment portfolios containing four stocks. The first portfolio will have an equal weighting between the stocks. The second portfolio will be optimized with a weighting allocation that provides the best return, adjusted for risk. To build these two portfolios, I will:
1. Import two years of data for four stocks
2. Build the initial portfolio with equal weighting to each of the stocks
3. Analyze and visualize the equal-weighted portfolio
4. Generate 10,000 portfolio scenarios with random weighting to each of the stocks
5. Identify the optimal portfolio from the scenarios and visualize the results

## Import packages needed for this project
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pandas_datareader.data as pdr
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf
import datetime as dt
import pandas_datareader as pdr
%matplotlib inline

## Lets find out more information about our stocks
The four stocks of interest are:
1. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Common Stock(AMD)
2. Apple Inc. - Common Stock(AAPL)
3. Microsoft Corporation - Common Stock(MSFT)
4. Oracle Corporation Common Stock(ORCL)

nasdaq_sym = pdr.nasdaq_trader.get_nasdaq_symbols()
nasdaq_sym.loc['AMD']
nasdaq_sym.loc['AAPL']
nasdaq_sym.loc['MSFT']
nasdaq_sym.loc['ORCL']

# Import two years of data for the four stock from yahoo finance
# Set start and end date parameters
startdate = dt.datetime(2020,1,1)
enddate = dt.datetime(2021,12,31)
# List the four stock ticker symbols for our portfolio
stock_list = ['AMD','AAPL','MSFT','ORCL']

# Create an empty dictionary to store our stock info
stocks = {}

# Loop through each stock in the stock_list and return the Adj Close
for i_stock in stock_list:
    stocks[i_stock] = yf.download(i_stock,startdate,enddate)[['Adj Close']]
