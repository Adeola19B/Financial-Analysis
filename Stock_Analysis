# Ehinmore Adebameno Portfolio on Financial Analysis

# Project - Portfolio Optimization
In this project, I will build two $10,000 investment portfolios containing four stocks. The first portfolio will have an equal weighting between the stocks. The second portfolio will be optimized with a weighting allocation that provides the best return, adjusted for risk. To build these two portfolios, I will:
1. Import two years of data for four stocks
2. Build the initial portfolio with equal weighting to each of the stocks
3. Analyze and visualize the equal-weighted portfolio
4. Generate 10,000 portfolio scenarios with random weighting to each of the stocks
5. Identify the optimal portfolio from the scenarios and visualize the results
